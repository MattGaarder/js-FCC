ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));

There is an accompanying <div> with id root (container for whole page) in the html.
We get ReactDOM (object) from the library.
Global variable with render() method that displays on screen.

First paramater is what do I want to place,
and second parameter is where I want to place it

Think of it like append child.

can also use .querySelector(#root);
